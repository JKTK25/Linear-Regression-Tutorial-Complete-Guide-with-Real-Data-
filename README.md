# Linear Regression Tutorial 📈  

A complete, beginner-friendly tutorial on **Linear Regression** — one of the most widely used algorithms in Machine Learning.  
This notebook walks you through the entire process of building, training, and evaluating a regression model in Python.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.  
This tutorial provides both **theoretical understanding** and **hands-on implementation** using real Python code and visualizations.

The notebook (`linear_regression_tutorial.ipynb`) is designed for:
- Students and educators learning Machine Learning fundamentals
- Data science beginners exploring predictive modeling
- Anyone interested in understanding how regression models work

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will learn to:

1. Understand the concept and mathematics behind Linear Regression  
2. Generate and visualize data for regression problems  
3. Implement Linear Regression using:
   - Manual mathematical approach (using NumPy)
   - Scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression` model  
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared (R²)
5. Interpret regression coefficients and predictions  
6. Visualize regression lines, residuals, and model fit

## 📊 Example Visualizations

The notebook includes:
- Scatter plots of features vs targets  
- Regression line overlay  
- Residuals plot to visualize prediction errors  
- Comparison of predicted vs actual values  

*(You can include sample plots here once the notebook is executed and saved as images)*

## 📈 Key Formulas

- **Linear Regression Equation**  
  \[ y = β_0 + β_1x + ε \]

- **Cost Function (MSE)**  
  \[ J(β_0, β_1) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (β_0 + β_1x_i))^2 \]

- **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**  
  \[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} \]
